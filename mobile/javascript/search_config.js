My sisters and I were born in the United States. My parents                                       spoke Yiddish to us; we answered in English. In that process, my parents’ English improved                                       immeasurably. Such is the case with many immigrant parents whose children are fluent                                       in English. They usually learn English much faster than others; they hear the language in                                       natural ways, in the context of daily life.                                          Learning a language in context, whether it be from the home, from work, or from a                                       textbook, cannot be overestimated. The challenge for me has been to find a variety of                                       high-interest topics to engage the adult language learner. I was thrilled to work on this new                                       edition of Grammar in Context for National Geographic Learning. In so doing, I have been                                       able to combine exciting new readings with captivating photos to exemplify the grammar.                                          I have given more than 100 workshops at ESL programs and professional conferences                                       around the United States, where I have gotten feedback from users of previous editions                                       of Grammar in Context. Some teachers have expressed concern about trying to cover long                                       grammar units within a limited time. While ESL is not taught in a uniform number of hours                                       per week, I have heeded my audiences and streamlined the series so that the grammar and                                       practice covered is more manageable. And in response to the needs of most ESL programs,                                       I have expanded and enriched the writing component.                                          Whether you are a new user of Grammar in Context or have used this series before, I                                       welcome you to this new edition.

To make a contraction (short form), we put an apostrophe (’) in place of the missing letter.               2.  We can make a contraction with a subject pronoun + am, is, and are.               3.  We can make a contraction with a singular subject + is.               4.  We cannot make a contraction with a plural noun + are.                      The dryers are empty.        Not: The dryers’re empty.                    GRAMMAR IN USE                 It is common to contract a noun or name + be in spoken English.                     Simon's from Mexico.

Simon:   I can help you with the rules. But in this state, drivers                    under the age of eighteen have to take a driver’s                    education class at school. It’s the law. You have to                    study thirty hours in the classroom.             Ed:     A class takes a long time. I can learn faster with you.             Simon:   No, you can’t.

You can have only one other teenager in the car. And                    after 9 p.m., you can drive home from work, but that’s all. You                    can’t drive alone at night for other reasons. Here, drivers under                    eighteen have to drive with an adult driver at night.

Pay special attention to the quantity expressions with count and noncount            nouns in bold.   6.4                 It’s time for a new school year. Today’s topic            is school lunches for your kids! Your children have            two choices: buy a lunch at school or bring a lunch            from home.                School lunches can be inexpensive and            convenient. They usually include a piece of fruit,            a carton of milk, and a protein, such as a piece            of fish or meat, or maybe a slice of pizza or a            sandwich. Pizza is always a favorite choice with kids.            Unfortunately, kids sometimes throw the fruit away.            Sometimes, students want a bottle of soda or a            piece of candy, but these are not healthy choices.            Students shouldn’t have any candy or soda.                 Other students bring their lunches to school.            They use a brown bag or a lunch box. Their parents            help them pack lunches with sandwiches, fruit,            vegetables, and maybe a healthy cookie or snack.            Some  parents still pack a bag of chips or a candy            bar. These choices have a lot of fat or sugar, and            aren’t very healthy. Vegetables are very healthy.

We don’t count them.                 EXAMPLES                                          EXPLANATION                One sandwich has jelly.                           A count noun has a singular and a plural form.                Two sandwiches have cheese.                       We can use a number with a count noun.                One child has a lunch box from home.                Twenty children get free lunch.                You need bread for a sandwich.                    A noncount noun has no plural form.                Victor drinks coffee every day.                   We don’t use a number with a noncount noun.                The school always serves fruit.                You must eat food every day.                Notes:                1.  You sometimes see the plural of fruit and food. Fruits means different kinds of fruit. Foods means                   different kinds of food.                2.  Some common noncount nouns are:                       Liquids: water, milk, cream, oil, tea, coffee, soup, juice                       dairy: milk, cream, cheese, ice cream, butter, yogurt                       Meats: beef, chicken, pork, fish, seafood                       Small things: salt, pepper, sugar, rice, candy, pasta, macaroni, corn, popcorn                       Baked goods: pizza, cake, bread, pie                        Other: food, fruit, meat, fat                                                                                                            School  127                        Copyright 2021 Cengage Learning.

Many dictionaries for English             language learners indicate if a noun is count or noncount. Some dictionaries use the term uncount instead of             noncount.

Peter:   There are many brands of shampoo. Why are there                        so many brands? Do people need so many choices?               Halina:   I don’t think so. Is there a difference between this                        shampoo for $3.99 and that shampoo for $10.99?               Peter:   I don’t know. Let’s buy the cheap one.                Halina:   OK. There’s probably no difference.               Peter:   Are there any other items on the shopping list?                Halina:   Just two. We need sugar. The sugar is in aisle 6.               (one minute later)                Halina:   This sign says 25 ounces for $1.75. That one says five                        pounds for $2.25. Which one is a better buy?                Peter:   I don’t know. What’s an ounce?                                     DID YOU KNOW?                                                                                           One pound = .45 kilograms               Halina:   It’s part of a pound. There are sixteen ounces in a pound.        One ounce = 28.35 grams               Peter:   Is there a calculator on your phone?               Halina:   Yes, but we don’t need it. Look. There’s a small sign under the                        sugar. The five-pound bag is about 2.8¢ an ounce. The 25-ounce                        bag is about 7¢ an ounce. The big bag is a better buy.               Peter:   You’re a smart shopper. Are we finished? Is there anything else on the list?                Halina:   Yes. There’s one more thing—dog food.                Peter:   Wow! Look. There are over twenty kinds of dog food.               Halina:   Dogs have choices, too.

Always use a form of be with the present continuous.                       is                      He working at that store.                        ^              2.  Don’t forget to use the -ing form with present continuous verbs.                                 are waiting                      Marta and Amy are wait at the drive-through.               3.  Use the correct word order in a question.                          is he                      What he is doing there?               4.  Don’t use the present continuous for usual or customary actions.                                       works                      Sometimes Simon is working on Saturdays.              5.  Follow the spelling rules for the -ing form.                              taking                      A clerk is takeing a customer’s order.                            showing                      Maya is showwing Lisa her art project.

Pay special attention to the comparative forms in bold.    10.1                In the United States, many students choose            to go to a community college. Students can get            a two-year certificate or degree. Some students            start their education at a community college. Then            they go to a four-year college or university to get a            bachelor’s degree.                A four-year university is more expensive than            a community college. The average tuition at a            community college is $3,347 a year. At a four-year            state university, it’s $9,970 a year.  A community                                      1            college is often closer to home than a four-year            college. Community colleges in big cities often have            several campuses.                There are other differences, too. A community            college often has smaller classes than a university. Some university classes can have            more than 100 students. Also, students at a community college are usually older than   DID YOU KNOW?            students at a four-year college. The average age of students at a community college is   There are different levels of            29. At a university, most students are between the ages of 18 and 24.                                                                                       college degrees: associate’s                                                                                       degree, bachelor’s degree,               Community college students are often busier, too. Many students have full- or   master’s degree, and PhD            part-time jobs and families. Community colleges are more convenient than universities   (or doctorate).            for students with small children. Many community colleges offer childcare. There are            more night and weekend classes, too.

Pay special attention to the superlative forms in bold.   10.5                Victor:   I want to buy a used car. My coworker, Sam, wants to sell me his 2014 car. He wants                        $6,000. Is that a good price?                Simon:   I don’t know. The best way to get information about used car prices is in the Kelley Blue Book®.               Victor:   What’s that?                Simon:   The Kelley Blue Book® shows prices and other information about new and used cars. It can                        help you. We can look at it online. Then you can make a decision.               (after Simon goes online)                                                  DID YOU KNOW?                Simon:   Look. Here’s your coworker’s car.                                 When you buy a new or used                                                                                          car, you do not always have               Victor:   There are three prices for the same car.

Cars in the                        best condition with the lowest mileage and the most extras are the most                        expensive. Cars with the highest mileage and the most problems are the cheapest.               Victor:   Sam says his car is in good condition.                Simon:   The best way to know for sure is to take it to a mechanic. You need a good car. Repairs                        are very expensive.               Victor:   But it costs money to go to a mechanic.                Simon:   It’s better to lose $300 than $6,000.                        But the price of the car is not the                        only thing to consider. Also look                        at fuel economy. There’s a website                        that compares fuel economy. Here                        it is. Look. Your coworker’s car gets                        only 19 miles per gallon .

This one gets                        35 miles per gallon. Your coworker’s                        car is the cheapest to buy, but it                        isn’t the most economical to use.

What jobs can people get in stores?              2.  How do people look for jobs?               READ            Read the following conversation. Pay special attention to the past of the verb be in bold.    11.1             Halina is talking to Dorota on the phone.            Dorota:  Hi, Halina. I stopped by your house several hours ago, but you weren’t home. Only Anna                    and Peter were there.             Halina:   I was at BigMart today.            Dorota:  Were there any good sales?             Halina:   I wasn’t there for the sales. I was there to apply for a job as a cashier. Positions are                    available now for the holidays. A lot of people were there, but they weren’t happy. There                    was a long line to apply for jobs.             Dorota:  Were there interviews today, too?            Halina:   No, there weren’t any interviews. I was surprised. The application was on a computer at the                    front of the store. That’s where the line was.            Dorota:  Many companies have job applications online now. I think you can fill out the application                    at home.             Halina:   I know that now.            Dorota:  Employers usually look at the applications and then interview people later if the                    application is a good one. How were the questions on the application? Were they hard to                    answer?            Halina:   They weren’t hard at all. They were easy. The first questions were about my job history                    and education. There were questions about references, too. You were one of my                    references, Dorota. I hope that’s okay. They’re going to contact you soon.            Dorota:  Of course! You can use me as a reference any time. What were some                    other questions?                                                   DID YOU KNOW?                                                                                       For jobs at stores and small            Halina:   There were some tricky questions. One was: “Your shift starts at 8:00.   businesses, there is at least                    Where should you be at 8:00? A) in the parking lot, B) in the employees’   one interview with future                    room, or C) in your department.”                                   employees. For professional            Dorota:  That is tricky! What was your answer?                             jobs, there are often two and                                                                                       sometimes three interviews.            Halina:   It wasn’t A or B. Time is important here. It was C, of course.              COMPREHENSION  Based on the reading, write T for true or F for false.              1.       A lot of people want a job at BigMart.             2.       Halina filled out the application at home.             3.       Halina didn’t know the answers to some questions.            246  Unit 11                        Copyright 2021 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

I parked five blocks away.               Dorota:  How late were you?               Halina:   Only 15 minutes. I ran to the office.                Dorota:  That’s too late for an interview. Next time, go to the                        place the day before the interview. You can check travel                        time and parking then.                Halina:   I didn’t like the interview, Dorota. It took an hour. There were                        two people behind a desk. They asked me a lot of questions.        DID YOU KNOW?                        And I felt nervous.

I worked a lot of hours. I didn’t make    become a regular employee.                        enough money.                Dorota:  You shouldn’t complain about your past jobs. Instead, say positive things about                        this new company.                Halina:   I did. I told them some good things. I said their company was easy to get to. I didn’t                        complain about the parking.               Dorota:  But you didn’t say anything about the company. Find out some information on the                        company’s website. What does the company do? What do you like about it?                        It’s important to know something about the company.               Halina:   I made a lot of mistakes in this interview. I said the wrong things.               Dorota:  Don’t worry. It was good practice. The next time is going to be easier. You’re going to be                        more prepared.

Write the irregular verbs from charts 11.9, 11.12, and 11.15 on slips of paper. (You do not have                  to write all the verbs.) Also write be on a slip of paper. Put all the slips in a bag. Student A begins by drawing a slip                  of paper. Ask any classmate (Student B) a question about the past, using the past form of the verb on the paper:                     A:  Nina, where did you go last year?                  Student B answers the question and then draws a new slip of paper and asks another student (Student C) a                  question. Continue around the circle. Answer the question and then ask a new question. Each correct question                  and each correct answer is worth 1 point. You get an extra point if you use a time expression.                     A:  Nina, where did you go last year?                     B:  I went to Florida.

Don’t use the simple past after to (the infinitive).                                spend                      He wanted to spent some time at the athletic club.              2.  Use the base form after did and didn’t.                                   go                      Where did she went after work?                                find                      They didn’t found good jobs.              3.

Don’t use did in subject questions about the past. Use the past form.                          happened                      What did happen at your interview today?              5.  Use the correct spelling of the -ed forms.                         applied                      She applyed for a job as a fitness instructor.               6.  Use the correct verb form. Remember, some verbs are irregular.                       hurt            broke                      I hurted my leg. He breaked his arm.

What’s your volunteer group doing this month?                Rhonda:  I work for an airline, and I’m a member of a volunteer organization. We have a program to                        help poor children in other countries. This month, we’re planning a trip to South America.

Charities help us, too. And airlines pay for the flights.               Marta:   Do you bring anything else to these people?                Rhonda:  Yes.

Was it another project in South America?                Rhonda:  Yes, it was. We brought a sick little boy from Colombia here to the United States. He                        needed an operation. They didn’t have medical care in his village. Two months later,                        I brought a healthy boy back to his parents. They were so happy. And I was, too.
